## Notes

One challenge that I ran into when creating the app was when creating the layout. Because Restraint Layout changed, 
I had to learn how to use Constraint Layout. I got stuck while trying to add items to the ListLayout but I asked one of the 
CodePath instructors for help after a couple of minutes and he helped me fix my layout. 

Additionally, when trying to modify the Gradle, I found that "compile" was out of date and ended up using "implementation". This
then created an error with "readLines" so I looked on StackOverflow and found that I needed to add a dependency to my gradle and 
change the way I imported FileUtils.
